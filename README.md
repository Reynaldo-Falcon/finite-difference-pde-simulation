# Finite Difference PDE Simulation

This repository features JavaScript and p5.js code for a program containing simulations for the numerical and analytical solutions for three partial differential equations (PDE). The three PDEs relevant for this study are the 2D Laplace equation, 1D Heat equation, and 1D Wave equation.

## Program Author
- Reynaldo J. Falcón Torres

## Purpose

This program was developed as part of a (mostly) open-topic group class project related to the course material. The undergraduate course, *Introduction to Modern Science Mathematics II* (MATE4072), was taken during the Spring semester of 2025 in the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus, and was taught by Dra. Karen R Rios-Soto.

## Language and libraries used
- JavaScript
- p5.js library

## How to Run The Program
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` using Live Server (A VS Code extension by Ritwick Dey) or another local web server.
3. Interact with the simulations directly in your browser.

## Features
- Numerical and analytical solution comparisons
- 2D and 1D PDE simulations
- Visualizations done with p5.js
