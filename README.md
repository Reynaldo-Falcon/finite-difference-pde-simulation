# finite-difference-pde-simulation
This repository features JavaScript and p5.js code for a program containing simulations for the numerical and analytical solutions for three partial differential equations (PDE). The three PDEs relevant for this study are the 2D Laplace equation, 1D Heat equation, and 1D Wave equation.
